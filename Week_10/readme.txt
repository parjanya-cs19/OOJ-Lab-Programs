Week 10: 
Lab Programs-7 and 8:

7. Write a program to demonstrate generics with multiple object parameters.

8. Write a program that demonstrates handling of exceptions in inheritance tree. Create a base class
called “Father” and derived class called “Son” which extends the base class. In Father class,
implement a constructor which takes the age and throws the exception Wrong Age( ) when the input
age=father’s age.

Week 10 – Extra Programs:

1. Implement Interfaces – QUEUE OPERATIONS

2. Write a program to demonstrate the following using generics.
  a. addition of three integers and three double values
  b. greatest of the above integers and doubles.
  
3. Write a Java program to compute the factorial of a number. The input value must be tested
for validity. If it is greater than 15, the method ComputeFactorial( ) should raise an
Userdefined Exception MyException with appropriate messages.

4. Write a Java program to create an account class. Define appropriate constructor for this
class. Implement a separate methods to display account balance and withdraw money.
Raise a user defined exception if there is an attempt to withdraw money which is greater
than the account balance. Make necessary assumptions required.
